icalevents
==========

iCal Events widget for Mac OS X Dashboard

Includes a full iCalendar parser written in Objective-C, including most recurrence rules (RRULE). Leopard and later systems use the Apple CalendarStore framework instead. I wrote much of this in 2005 as a college freshman, so the code quality may be very bad.
